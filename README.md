## Hi there 👋

I'm Maïa Kalina, and I'm venturing into the exciting world of tech with a focus on data science. I'm passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems and am thrilled to be taking my first steps in this field.

### About Me

🌱 I'm currently diving deep into Python and exploring the realms of data analysis and machine learning.

🔭 I have successfully completed my HyperionDev skills bootcamp with an average grade of 96%.

👯 I'm open to collaboration on any projects! I'm eager to learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful work.

🤔 I'm a keen learner with a sharp academic mind. I'm always looking to learn from those who excel in their craft.

💬 Outside of tech, I have a keen interest in politics and hold an MA in Political Science, I am values driven and care a lot about environment and animal welfare.
I enjoy practicing yoga and indulging in pole dance fitness in my spare time.

😄 Fun fact: I learned to cycle at the age of 33—better late than never!
