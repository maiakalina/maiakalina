## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm MaÃ¯a Kalina, and I'm venturing into the exciting world of tech with a focus on data science. I'm passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems and am thrilled to be taking my first steps in this field.

### About Me

ðŸŒ± I'm currently diving deep into Python and exploring the realms of data analysis and machine learning.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm working on completing my HyperionDev skills bootcamp, where I'm honing my skills and building projects.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaboration on any projects! I'm eager to learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful work.

ðŸ¤” I'm a keen learner with a sharp academic mind. I'm always looking to learn from those who excel in their craft.

ðŸ’¬ Outside of tech, I enjoy practicing yoga and indulging in pole dance fitness in my spare time.

ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: I learned to cycle at the age of 33â€”better late than never!
